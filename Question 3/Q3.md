# Perform Boundary Traversal of matrix

You are given a matrix of dimensions n x m. The task is to perform boundary traversal on the matrix in a clockwise manner.

#### Example 1:
`Input:
n = 4, m = 4
matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
         {5, 6, 7, 8},
         {9, 10, 11, 12},
         {13, 14, 15,16}}`

`Output: 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5`

#### Explanation: 
The matrix is:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
The boundary traversal is:
1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5


#### Example 2:

`Input:
n = 3, m = 4
matrrix[][] = {{12, 11, 10, 9},
         {8, 7, 6, 5},
         {4, 3, 2, 1}}`
`Output: 12 11 10 9 5 1 2 3 4 8`


#### Your Task:
Complete the function boundaryTraversal() that takes matrix, n and m as input parameters and returns the list of integers that form the boundary traversal of the matrix in a clockwise manner.

* Expected Time Complexity: O(N + M)
* Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

#### Constraints:
* 1 <= n, m<= 1000
* 0 <= matrixi <= 1000
